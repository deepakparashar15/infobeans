4. E-Commerce Discount Engine

An online shopping platform provides discounts to customers based on
 their total purchase amount:

* Above ₹5000 → 20% discount
* ₹2000 to ₹5000 → 10% discount
* Below ₹2000 → 5% discount

Write a Python program to calculate the final amount after discount.

Input:
Enter purchase amount: 4500

Output:
Final Amount: ₹4050
'''

amount = float(input("Enter purchase amount: "))

if amount > 5000:
    final_amount = amount - (amount * 20 / 100)

elif amount >= 2000:
    final_amount = amount - (amount * 10 / 100)

else:
    final_amount = amount - (amount * 5 / 100)

print("Final Amount:", final_amount)
