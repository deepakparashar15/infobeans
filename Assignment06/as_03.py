3. Income Tax Department System

The Income Tax Department needs a system to calculate tax payable by citizens based on their annual income:

* Up to ₹2,50,000 → No tax
* ₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000 → 5% tax
* ₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000 → 20% tax
* Above ₹10,00,000 → 30% tax

Write a Python program to calculate the tax amount.

Input:
Enter annual income: 800000

Output:
Tax Payable: ₹11000
'''
income = int(input("Enter annual income: "))

if income <= 250000:
    tax = 0

elif income <= 500000:
    tax = income * 0.05

elif income <= 1000000:
    tax = income * 0.20

else:
    tax = income * 0.30

print("Tax Payable:", tax)
