15. Smart Parking System
A smart parking system charges based on vehicle type and parking duration:

* Bike → ₹10/hour
* Car → ₹20/hour
* Bus → ₹50/hour
  If parking duration exceeds 5 hours, an additional ₹100 penalty is applied.

Write a Python program to calculate total parking fee.

Input:
Enter vehicle type: Car
Enter hours parked: 6

Output:
Total Parking Fee: ₹220
'''

vehicle = input("Enter vehicle type: ")
hours = int(input("Enter hours parked: "))

if vehicle == "Bike":
    rate = 10
elif vehicle == "Car":
    rate = 20
else:
    rate = 50
fee = rate * hours

if hours > 5:
    fee = fee + 100

print("Total Parking Fee: ₹", fee)
